Check uplighter schematic:
    * tl4242 dissipation (with 3W star)
        * Red: P = 350mA * (5 - 2.5 - 0.177) = 0.81W
        * Green: P = 0.35 * (5 - 3.3 - 0.177) = 0.53W
        * Blue: 0.53W
    * For 1W star:
        * Red: P = 150mA * (5 - 2.5 - 0.177) = 0.35W
        * Green: P = 0.15 * (5 - 3.3 - 0.177) = 0.23W
        * Blue: 0.23W
        * Thermal R is somewhere between 4 or 50 or 114. All okay for 1W star
    * tl4242 setup: Looks good
    * led/sense R setup: Looks good
    * connectors match node schematic: Yep
Check node schematic:
    * 7805 and psu setup: looks good
    * attiny pin assignment: looks good
    * attiny periphs (power, xtal, reset), ICSP: Good
    * bus driver setup: Good
    * driver design: Good
    * output connector sanity: Uh huh
    * other connector sanity: Yup!
Check uplighter pcb
    * heatsink size/shape/pinout: Done
    * heatsink/led mechanical considerations: Fine
    * pcb mechanical considerations: ??? fine
    * 8-son footprint: Rejiggled.
check node pcb:
    * Not much really
check pcbs fit together: do at end.
TPs!
