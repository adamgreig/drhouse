Check uplighter schematic:
    * tl4242 dissipation (with 3W star)
        * Red: P = 350mA * (5 - 2.5 - 0.177) = 0.81W
        * Green: P = 0.35 * (5 - 3.3 - 0.177) = 0.53W
        * Blue: 0.53W
        * Total: 1.87W
        * Pretty unacceptable for a 50K/W thermal resistance to ambient!
    * For 1W star:
        * Red: P = 150mA * (5 - 2.5 - 0.177) = 0.35W
        * Green: P = 0.15 * (5 - 3.3 - 0.177) = 0.23W
        * Blue: 0.23W
        * Total: 0.81W
        * Toasty, but probably acceptable.
    * tl4242 setup
    * led/sense R setup
    * connectors match node schematic.
Check node schematic:
    * 7805 and psu setup
